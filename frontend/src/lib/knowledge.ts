      Mental wellness is a positive state of mental health. It's more than just the absence of mental illness; it's the presence of mental, emotional, and social well-being.

      ### Key Pillars:
      1. **Emotional Balance**: Being aware of your emotions and being able to manage them effectively.
      2. **Psychological Resilience**: The ability to bounce back from life's challenges and adapt to change.
      3. **Social Connection**: Feeling a sense of belonging and support from others.

      ### Why it Matters:
      When you are mentally well, you can realize your full potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and make meaningful contributions to your community.

      Misconceptions about mental health can prevent people from seeking help. Let's look at the facts.

      ### Myth #1: Mental health problems are rare.
      **Fact**: 1 in 4 people will experience a mental health problem in any given year.

      ### Myth #2: Mental health problems are a sign of weakness.
      **Fact**: Mental health conditions are biological and psychological realities, similar to physical health conditions like diabetes. They have nothing to do with being "weak" or "lazy."

      ### Myth #3: You can't do anything for someone with a mental health problem.
      **Fact**: Support from friends and family is one of the most important factors in recovery. Simply being there and listening makes a massive difference.

      Did you know 95% of your serotonin is produced in your gut, not your brain?

      ### The Vagus Nerve Highway:
      Your gut and brain are connected by the Vagus Nerve. Stress signals travel down, and gut health signals travel up.

      ### Feeding Your Mood:
      - **Probiotics**: Fermented foods (yogurt, kimchi) support healthy bacteria.
      - **Prebiotics**: Fiber-rich foods (garlic, onions, bananas) feed that bacteria.
      - **Sugar**: High sugar intake promotes "bad" bacteria that can increase inflammation and anxiety.

      ### What it Means:
      Your brain is not fixed. Every time you think a thought or practice a behavior, you strengthen that neural pathway.

      ### The Path in the Grass:
      Imagine walking through tall grass. The first time is hard. The 100th time, there is a clear path.
      - **Anxiety** is a well-worn path.
      - **Calm** is a new path you are building. It takes effort at first, but eventually, it becomes the default.

      1. **Sleep Hygiene**: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day. Your brain cleans itself of toxins only during deep sleep.
      2. **Physical Connection**: Movement releases endorphins and reduces cortisol. Even a 10-minute walk counts.
      3. **Nutrition**: What you eat affects your gut microbiome, which is directly linked to your mood through the "Gut-Brain Axis."

      ### Burnout Prevention:
      Set "Hard Boundaries" between work/study and rest. Learn to say "No" without explanation.

      1. **Physical**: Your personal space and physical touch.
      2. **Emotional**: Separating your feelings from others'. You are not responsible for "fixing" everyone's bad mood.
      3. **Time**: Protecting your resting hours from work or demanding friends.

      ### Essential Phrases:
      - "I'm not in a place to hold space for that right now. Can we talk about it tomorrow?"
      - "I'd love to help, but I've reached my limit for today."

      Your brain does its most important "maintenance work" while you sleep. Poor sleep is a leading contributor to anxiety and depression.

      ### The Sleep Stack:
      - **Blue Light**: The "blue light" from phones tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime, suppressing melatonin. Stop scrolling 1 hour before bed.
      - **Temperature**: A cool room (around 18°C) is optimal for deep sleep.
      - **Consistency**: Your "Circadian Rhythm" loves a schedule. Wake up at the same time even on weekends.

      ### The 10-3-2-1 Rule:
      - **10 hours** before bed: No more caffeine.
      - **3 hours** before bed: No more food or alcohol.
      - **2 hours** before bed: No more work.
      - **1 hour** before bed: No more screens.

      ### 2. Gratitude (for Negativity):
      List 3 specific things. "Coffee" is vague. "The warmth of the mug in my cold hands" is specific. Specificity drives the emotion.

      ### 3. Bullet Journaling (for Order):
      Use symbols to track mood, habits, and tasks. Great for seeing patterns over time.

      2. **Chronic Stress**: Long-term stress that feels never-ending (like financial issues or relationship strain).

      Instead of saying "I'm stressed," try to be more precise:
      - Is it **Overwhelm**? (Too much to do)
      - Is it **Anxiety**? (Fear of something future)
      - Is it **Frustration**? (Blocked from a goal)

      - Ask a stranger for the time.
      - Say hi to one new person.

      ADHD isn't a deficit of attention; it's a difficulty in *regulating* attention.

      ### Chase the Dopamine (Constructively):
      - **Gamification**: Turn chores into a game with rewards.
      - **Body Doubling**: Work alongside someone else (even virtually). The social pressure helps you stay on task.

      ### The "Now / Not Now" Time Blindness:
      To an ADHD brain, there are only two times: Now and Not Now. Use visible timers (like analog clocks) to make time "real."

      Sleep is a shy cat. If you chase it, it runs. You have to sit quietly and let it come to you.

      ### Paradoxical Intention:
      If you can't sleep, try to stay awake. Keep your eyes open in the dark. Removing the *pressure* to sleep often relaxes the brain enough to drift off.

      ### The 20-Minute Rule:
      If you haven't slept in 20 minutes, get out of bed. Do something boring in low light. Only return to bed when sleepy. This teaches your brain that Bed = Sleep, not Bed = Worry.

      ### The Fear of Failure:
      Often, the fear isn't about the grade itself, but what the grade "means" about your worth. Remind yourself: **Your GPA is not your worth.**

      ### Tactics:
      - **The 25/5 Rule**: Work for 25 minutes, rest for 5.

      Procrastination is usually not a time-management problem; it's an **emotion-management** problem. We avoid tasks because they make us feel anxious, bored, or incompetent.

      Tell yourself you will only do the task for 5 minutes. Usually, the hardest part is starting. Once you start, the "Zeigarnik Effect" (the brain's desire to finish a started task) kicks in.

      ### Break it Down:
      "Write Essay" is too big. "Open Word Document" is a task. "Type the Title" is a task. Make it so small that it's impossible to fail.

      ### Breakups & Loss:
      Grief is not linear. It's perfectly normal to feel "okay" one day and devastated the next. Treat yourself with the same compassion you would show a houseplant – give yourself time, space, and basic care.

      ### Conflict Resolution:
      Use "I" statements instead of "You" statements.
      - **Instead of**: "You never listen to me!"
      - **Try**: "I feel unheard when I'm sharing my day and you're on your phone."

      This reduces defensiveness and keeps the focus on the connection.

      ### Recovery Steps:
      - **Audit Your Time**: Identify "energy vampires" in your schedule.
      - **Set Hard Stops**: When you leave work, actually leave. No checking emails or Slack.

      Grief is not a linear process of "five stages." It's more like a ball in a box with a pain button. Initially, the ball is huge and hits the button constantly. Over time, the ball gets smaller, hitting the button less often—but it still hurts just as much when it does.

      ### Gentle Steps:
      - **Permission to Feel**: Don't force yourself to "move on" before you are ready.
      - **Ritual**: Creating a small way to honor what was lost.
      - **Connection**: Sharing your memories or pain with someone who can listen without trying to "fix" it.

      1. **Listen Without Fixing**: Often, your presence is more valuable than your advice.
      2. **Maintain Boundaries**: You are a supporter, not a clinician. Ensure they have professional help so the weight isn't all on you.

      The job you will have in 10 years might not even exist yet.

      ### The Lighthouse Method:
      Don't try to map the whole ocean. Just look for the next lighthouse. What is the *next* right step? An internship? A class? A conversation?
      Action cures fear. Take one small step, and the next lighthouse will become visible.

      ### Comparison is the Thief of Joy:
      Life is not a linear track. Some people sprint and burn out. Some walk and keep going forever.
      You are not "behind." You are exactly where *you* are.

      We stay up late because it's the only time we feel "in control" of our lives.

      ### The Trade-off:
      You are stealing happiness from your future self to pay for a moment of freedom now.
      Try to build "freedom" into your day (even 15 mins) so you don't feel the desperate need to reclaim it at 1 AM.

      Our brains are fried by cheap dopamine (likes, scrolls, sugar).

      ### The Protocol:
      For 24 hours: No screens. No sugar. No music.
      It will be boring. That is the point. Boredom resets your baseline. Suddenly, reading a book or walking outside feels interesting again.

      "Loving" your body every day is a high bar. Try "respecting" it.

      ### Instrument > Ornament:
      Instead of "Does my stomach look flat?", ask "Can my legs carry me up this hill? Can my arms hug my friend?"
      Shift the focus from how you *look* to what you can *do*.

      Gratitude isn't just "being nice." It's a cognitive training program.

      ### The "Three Good Things" Exercise:
      Every night, write down 3 things that went well and *why*.
      After 21 days, your brain starts scanning the world for positives instead of threats. It's biological reprogramming.
